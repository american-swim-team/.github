# Hi there 👋, welcome to Swim>!

## Intro
Swim> is an assetto corsa network started by wheres981.

## 🦹🏿 Who?
Swim> is run and maintained by wheres981 and Romedius. Want to speak with us? Reach out on [discord](discord.gg/swim-ac)

## 🧾 Details on the servers
Our servers tend to use more realistic car models than competitors and reward for consistency and synergy instead of speed. Players running our cutup script are rewarded for driving along with other players, which creates a unique atmosphere. Currently, the cutup script is only available on our paid servers, and we run the following maps:
- SRP (Shutoku Revival Project)
- FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive) [Patreon Map](https://www.patreon.com/andrepradiktha/posts)
- JRP (Jackie Robinson Parkway) [Patreon Map](https://www.patreon.com/andrepradiktha/posts)

## 💻 Technical details
Programming is done in python, lua and rust. Code is tested and deployed on linux systems. The infrastructure and usage of our servers is monitored using loki and grafana, which gives valuable insight into performance and players statistics.

## 🧙 Contribution
If you feel like you could contribute to any open source code, fork the repository and open a pull request. If you'd like to contribute in any other way, such as car models in assetto corsa, or code contributions to any of the private repositories, reach out on [discord](discord.gg/swim-ac). Simply ping @Romedius in the #suggestions channel and explain you're either a dev or a 3D artist.

## 📒 Documentation
I will try to keep the code well documented, and keep instructions for building and deploying, as well as basic usage in the README of each repository. If I feel more documentation is needed I'll add more markdown files.
