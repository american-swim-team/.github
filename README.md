## Details on the servers
Our servers tend to use more realistic car models than competitors and reward for consistency and synergy instead of speed. Players running our cutup script are rewarded for driving along with other players, which creates a unique atmosphere. Currently, the cutup script is only available on our paid servers, and we run the following maps:
- SRP (Shutoku Revival Project)
- FDR (Franklin D. Roosevelt East River Drive) [Patreon Map](https://www.patreon.com/andrepradiktha/posts)
- JRP (Jackie Robinson Parkway) [Patreon Map](https://www.patreon.com/andrepradiktha/posts)

## Technical details
Programming is done in python, lua and rust. Code is tested and deployed on linux systems. The infrastructure and usage of our servers is monitored using loki and grafana, which gives valuable insight into performance and players statistics.
